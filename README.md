# CleanCodersNet
My .Net Version of the code produced following  Robert C. Martin's Java Case Study  which is available at cleancoders.com at the  following link https://cleancoders.com/series/java-case-study.    It uses C# instead of Java and specFlow instead of fitnesse to make a better experience for use .detters.

The code of the Episode2.0 tag is a bit ahead of the series.  This is due to going through this part a 2nd time and jumping a head a bit.  My appologies.

Thanks
